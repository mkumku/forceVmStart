To make it working with 3.4
===========================
1) What are the fields to be used in cmd when we start the VM?
- Check if the current filds still exist in the ovf
- Check the fields sent in livbirt.xml by vdsm
2) Change the parsing process. Can we make it more generic?
3) Confirm Vm is actually starting.
4) Seems like even if vm is running currently, the tool ignores it

Future Features list:
=====================
- Make the tool compatible with 3.5 vdsm

- Check all the hosts in the cluster, and if some are unaccessible - add warning and do not proceed, until a flag --force is added
- Check it is working with hosted engine
- Add connection timeout
